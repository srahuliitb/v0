Focus on the intrinsic value of a subject, not the external rewards it may bring. Don't let the allure of rewards dictate your passion; rather, cultivate a genuine love for the subject itself. When one becomes enamored with the intrinsic qualities of a field, be it art, science, or any pursuit, the journey becomes more fulfilling. This approach fosters a deeper connection, as the joy of exploration and learning transcends material gains. Embracing the subject for its own sake leads to sustained motivation, resilience in the face of challenges, and a richer understanding. It's a reminder to cherish the process, appreciating the inherent beauty and significance of what you're engaging with, rather than being driven solely by external recognition or benefits. In essence, true passion lies in the pursuit of knowledge and the genuine love for the subject matter itself, transcending superficial rewards.
